## 1 Installation & PyPI

The version 1.0.0 of this application has been published on the [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can find the package on PyPI through this [**link**](https://pypi.org/project/GEDCOM-Benji/), you can also install the package with `pip`:

```py
pip install gedcom-ajry
```

## 2 Test Strategy 

- [ ] Create a GEDCOM file with **NO** fault.
- [ ] Modify the file copy and manually create some weired cases.
  - **one weired cases for each modified file**
  - (**to be discussed**)merge the modified files the same time merging the tested code
- [ ] Expecting the program can find these weired cases.
